On 12/21/2023 AP-MS Uniprot IDs were mapped to Gene_Name s using the Uniprot
id-mapping service. 

From 3,005 ids to 3,027 Gene_Names
The reverse mapping supports 3,002 Gene Names 

Two ids were not mapped

Q8NFD4 : Uncharacterized protein FLJ76381
Q6ZSR9 : Uncharacterized protein FLJ45252

This accounts for 3,004 Gene Names

The remaining Gene Name is TMPO Lamina-associated polypeptide 2 
with two uniprot ids

    'P42166', 'P42167'

These correspond to isoforms alpha and beta/gamma respectivley.

We choose to leave both proported isofroms in the data
